      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn. You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Many people may come to visit my site in order to see what I have accomplished. An employer may visit my site to see if I have the skills needed to work in the position in which either they are recruiting me for or the positions which I will apply for. They will be looking to see if the way I work will be a good fit for what they need done at their company. There will also be those who are looking at my portfolio to see if I will be a good fit for their graduate program. These people will care less about the work I have done for companies and more about the research I have done. They will care to see if I have taught as either a teaching assistant or as a tutor and will ask me to show off my educational pursuits. Others may be looking at my portfolio to see examples that they can use to learn or to see what someone who studies data science might even do. This would cause me to want to include my resume and skill set on my home page as well as a brief description of who I am and a bit about how I've gotten to the point I'm at currently. By including these personal touches I will help others to understand who I am, what I've done and where I want to go.

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I want to make sure that my website includes much of the work that I have done both for school, work, and data science society. This would include things like a project that I did for the Madison Fire Department to help them out with their budgeting. I would also want to include the work I did with the BYU-i supply chain department to help them create an app that would allow them to simulate the supply chain process. I would also like to add the report that I made for the Fremont School district with visuals displaying important survey information and visuals that would allow them to understand how they would want to proceed to make their district a safer place. I would also want to show off some projects from classes like the statistics consulting project I did for the school vending machines. I would also want to include reports that I have done for work and include some of the information from dashboards that I have made for the school.

      </ul>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>
        I would also want a page showing off my skills. I want to have some space that shows off my skills creating data visualizations. This page will show a couple different graphs and ways that I have created the visuals using several different prominent visualization software, such as ggplot2, plotly express, letsplot, Power BI, Tableau, Seaborn and altair. I would also want to show what I could do with data wrangling, and how I can create a tidy data set. I would once again want to show that I can do this across several different softwares like SQL, pandas, polars, tidyverse, and DAX. I would also want to show off projects I have done for others. I would also like to show off some skills that I have in creating predictive models. I would want to show off that I know how to do simple and multiple regression, as well as logistic regression, and my experience using machine learning models such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting. I would also want to show off my skills using neural networks, as well as my understanding regarding convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.
